A high-precision machine learning web application that classifies SMS messages as 'Spam' or 'Ham' (Legitimate).

🚀 Key Highlights
Data Processing: Vectorized 5,500+ raw messages using TF-IDF and NLTK to extract patterns for robust text classification.

Model Training: Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, benchmarking against 10+ ML algorithms to identify the optimal solution.

Performance: Achieved 97% accuracy and 100% precision, effectively eliminating false positives for non-spam messages.

Deployment: Developed a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for real-time message testing.
